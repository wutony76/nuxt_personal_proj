// deck is a Design Component whose <helmet> links ../../styles.css ahead of
// the deck's own <style>, so the deck's rules win equal-specificity ties in
// every load path — a script-injected sheet would land after that <style>
// and silently outrank it, live and in published artifacts alike. The window
// flag makes the load one-shot: a Design Component evaluates helmet scripts
// twice when the page is opened directly (once from the parsed document,
// once from the runtime's recreated helmet copy), and the bundle must not
// run twice. In a consuming project, point base at the bound _ds/<folder>
// tree relative to this page — one line to edit.
